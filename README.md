# Machine Learning-Driven Op-Amp Design with Explainable AI: A Transfer Learning Approach from TSMC N65 to SKY130
In this project, we propose a black-box machine learning (ML) model called Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to capture the relationship between component parameters and performance metrics in op-amp circuits. After training the black-box model, we employ an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique called Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to analyze how each component parameter impacts specific performance metrics, thereby providing actionable design insights. Additionally, this study incorporates transfer learning to bridge knowledge from TSMC N65 to the SKY130 technology node, facilitating efficient design adaptation to a new technology node.
